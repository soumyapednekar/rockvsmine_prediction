Logistic Regression

SONAR Object Detection
This project aims to build a system in Python that can predict whether an object is either a Rock or Mine using SONAR data. To employ a Logistic Regression Model for the prediction.

Introduction
SONAR (Sound Navigation and Ranging) is a technique that uses sound propagation to navigate, communicate with, or detect objects underwater. In this project, we utilize SONAR data to differentiate between rocks and mines in a given environment.

Implementation
The implementation of this project is carried out using Python programming language. We chose to utilize Google Colaboratory for Python programming due to its ease of use and availability of computational resources.

Tools and Libraries Used:
Python 3.x
Google Colaboratory
NumPy
Pandas
Scikit-learn
